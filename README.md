# Orange OS LE CLI Install Script

The name says it all, a install script for the [Orange OS Linux Edition](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/620114/) OS!

A GUI install system is coming soon, but for now, this is your only option.

## How to install:

### A stable version (latest 0.1.0) (recommended for most people)
Download and boot an [Arch linux ISO](https://archlinux.org/download/), then in the live enviroment, run

```
curl https://orange-os-le.github.io/0.1.0_CLI_Install.txt > install.py
python3 install.py
```
You can replace 0.1.0 with the version you want to download.
0.0.0 is not an option.

Then answer the questions. Note, that this isn't the final release and a lot is missing.

The install process is a bit buggy right now, so testing is apreciated.

### Beta version (0.2.0) (not recommended)

Download and boot an [Arch linux ISO](https://archlinux.org/download/), then in the live enviroment, run

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orange-OS-LE/CLI_Installer/master/script_part_1.py > install.py
python3 install.py
```

Then answer the questions. Note, that this isn't the final release and a lot is missing.

The install process is a bit buggy right now, so testing is apreciated.

## Roadmap
```
0.1.x (released) - Adds gnome desktop enviroment
0.2.x (beta) - Config file support
0.3.x - UI changes
0.4.x - Adds some gnome extensions
1.0.x - Adds an updating system
```

This roadmap may not be completely followed.

## Config (not released yet) (probably broken)

### Config file syntax
```
line 1: Path to hard drive
line 2: Hostname
line 3: Keyboard layout (all lowercase)
line 4: Language locale
line 5: Timezone (slash between places, places starting with a capital letter)
line 6: Country
line 7: Amount of users to be added
```
After that, the lines are username, password and whether the user is a superuser (leave blank if not). Repeat those lines for each user.

You can find an example config file in examples/simple.config.

### How to use a config file

Run the installer with an extra argument, that being the config file path
```
python3 install.py my_config.config
```
